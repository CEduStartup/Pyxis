Logger Component
================

This component shows logger events, occurred in the system and which were sent via message queue.
It listens for own tube, and will handle different log levels with custom actions.

By now it runs by next commands:
python manager.py

and shows all log events

The simplest code to check it works is:

from shared.events.EventManager import EventSender
from config.mq import QUEUE_HOST, QUEUE_PORT
EventSender(QUEUE_HOST, QUEUE_PORT).fire('LOGGER.INFO', message='Just a test!')
